a dockerfile that installs [netbox-scanner](https://github.com/forkd/netbox-scanner) and runs with it... this can be deployed alongside netbox or into any container runtime you need.

[Check their wiki](https://pypi.org/project/netbox-scanner/)

## Build it

```
git clone https://github.com/ToroNZ/netbox-scanner-container
cd netbox-scanner-container
docker build -t toronz/nebox-scanner-docker:latest .
```

## Run it

If your running it for the first time, create a sample config file:

`docker run --rm -ti -v `pwd`:/root toronz/netbox-scanner-docker:latest`

This will drop a hidden file under your current directory. After the config is set, you can mounted it as follow:

`docker run --rm -ti -v `pwd`/.netbox-scanner.conf:/root/.netbox-scanner.conf toronz/netbox-scanner-docker:latest`
